## Summative Assessment 3

### Overview

The scenario that I have decided to pick is scenario 1: personalized fashion recommender model using generative A.I. The personalized fashion recommender is a solution developed for StyleSavvy, a cutting-edge fashion-tech company. This system leverages generative AI and Gemini 1.5 Pro to deliver fashion recommendations tailored based on the user's preferences, body type, and current trends. By dynamically adapting to seasonal changes, new fashion styles, and emerging trends, the model aims to revolutionize the way users interact with fashion. <br/>

### Requirements
The following libraries are required for the project to run:
1. google.generativeai
Visual Studio code was used to create and test this project.
 

### Main Research Findings

In order to make an effective fashion recommender, proper research needs to be conducted. The following findings influenced the project heavily: </br>

1. User choice depends primarily on demographics (age, gender, culture), body type, and lifestyle. </br>
2. Users generally select their outfits based on events or occasions, such as business meetings, vacations, festivals, concerts, etc. </br>
3. Existing systems seem to lack personalization for different body types, fabric preferences and seasonal trends. </br>
4. There is an increasing demand for eco-friendly fashion materials which highlights the importance of sustainable clothing recommendations. </br>
